Assignment 1 - Readme - Felipe Orrico Scognamiglio (933-327-510)

1) The Methods:
    I) For each of the used methods in my Assignment, not including main, I put a comment on top of the method explaining its functionality.
    II) I didn't bother to comment all the code inside the methods because I believe the code is relatively easy to follow and comprehend.
    Most of the code is iterating through the linked list to find matches and add them to a new linked list of the matches.
    III) Please contact me using my OSU email (orricosf@oregonstate.edu) in case there is any part of the code that requires some explanation.
    We can schedule some time on Zoom to address that.
    IV) The main method is in movies.c

2) Compiling the Code:
    I) I added a Makefile to compile the code. All you have to do is run "make" or "make all" to create the movies executable.
    II) To clear all the made files run "make clean"

3) Running the Program:
    I) To run the executable, run "./movies <filename>" where "<filename>" is the name of the file (Example: "movie_sample_1.csv").
    II) If the program tries to open a file that does not exist, an error will be displayed on screen and the program will exit.
